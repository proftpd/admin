Here's just some ideas for features for the future.  (Yes, as I freely
admit, I'm one of the worst perpetrators of feeping creaturism for
proftpd.)

Events API

mod_conf_ldap
  + module for reading/constructing proftpd.conf information from LDAP
    (LDAP version of mod_conf_sql)

mod_search
  + implements a SITE SEARCH command, for using nftw(3), globs and regexs
    for scanning a site for a given filename pattern

mod_vscan
  + scan for viruses on incoming and outgoing files

mod_magic
  + use libmagic for identifying a given file type (a la file(1))

mod_auth_ntlm
  + authenticating against a Windows box

mod_snmp
  + expose an interface for SNMP monitoring of the server status
  + generate traps based on certain events?  Requires Events API

mod_slp
  + see www.openslp.org

EBCDIC support
