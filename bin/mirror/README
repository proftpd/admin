                     ProFTPD Mirror Maintenance Scripts
                     ==================================

These scripts generate web pages and DNS zone fragments to support the
ProFTPD mirror network.

These scripts require a command line PHP binary (#!/usr/bin/php) and the
DB, Mail, Console_Getopt, HTTP_Request, Net_URL, and Console_ProgressBar
PEAR modules, which can be installed with 'pear install modulenames'

    o addMirror.php (web page)
      Submit a new mirror. This is the script behind
      http://mirrors.proftpd.org/.

    o checkMirrors.php
      Check all mirrors to ensure they are reachable and up-to-date.

    o dnsZone.php
      Generate a DNS zone fragment for the mirror network. Note that this
      only generates the DNS entries for the mirror network - its output
      must be added manually to the proftpd.org DNS zone and the SOA serial
      number incremented. It's a good idea to 'cvs diff' the zone file
      before committing it, just to make sure.

    o mirrorList.php
      Generate a proftpd.org web page for the mirror network. Must be run
      twice, once for each mirror type (www, ftp).

I run checkMirrors.php from cron once a week. If you keep up with broken
mirrors, handling the small amount of broken mirrors weekly isn't a big
chore. It also ensures that users can rely on the mirror network, since
problems will be noticed quickly.

Once a broken mirror is detected, I bounce the e-mail generated by
checkMirrors.php to the mirror admin. I leave the mirror active until the
following week, since most mirror admins will respond promptly and you won't
have to remove their mirror. After a week, I disable the mirror and update
the web site (mirrorList.php) and proftpd.org DNS zone (dnsZone.php).
