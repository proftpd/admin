Hello, ProFTPD community. The ProFTPD Project team is pleased to announce
that the final release for ProFTPD 1.2.5 is now available for public
consumption.

You can download 1.2.5, including PGP signatures and MD5 sums, from any
of the proftpd mirrors.  Mirrors are available via FTP as

you should select one that is geographically close to you.

Alternatively, you can download proftpd from the main site:

  - new mod_sql, version 4.08:
    This version fixes numerous bugs and compatibility issues.

Please read the included NEWS and ChangeLog files for the full details.

My PGP key has been used to sign the source tarballs as well as this
announcement; it is available via MIT's public keyserver.
