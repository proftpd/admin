Hello, ProFTPD community. The ProFTPD Project team is pleased to announce
that the first release candidate for ProFTPD 1.2.8 is now available
for public consumption.

You can download 1.2.8rc1, including PGP signatures and MD5 sums, from any
of the proftpd mirrors.  Mirrors are available via FTP as:

  ftp.<two_letter_iso_country_code>.proftpd.org

(example: ftp.nl.proftpd.org).  Not all countries have mirrors; however
you should select one that is geographically close to you.

Alternatively, you can download proftpd from the main site:

  ftp://ftp.proftpd.org/distrib/source

RPMs, once available, will be placed here:

  ftp://ftp.proftpd.org/distrib/packages/RPMS

The 1.2.8rc1 release includes numerous new features, including:

  - New configuration directives:
       AuthOrder:
         Configure the order in which authentication modules are called,
         on a per-virtual server basis.

       DebugLevel:
         Configure the debugging level in the configuration file, rather
         than just on the command line.  This is similar to the -d 
         command line option.  Using this directive, obtaining debugging
         output from inetd-run servers now requires modifiying the
         proftpd.conf file, rather than the inetd configuration.

       ListOptions:
         The LsDefaultOptions configuration directive has been replaced
         with this new directive.  ListOptions provides the same features
         as LsDefaultOptions, with the ability to "override" whatever
         options are used by the client when requesting directory
         listings; this allows for administrators to block recursive
         directory listing requests from clients, if they wish.
 
       LinuxPrivsEngine, LinuxPrivsCapabilities:
         These new directives allow for an administrator to disable
         mod_linuxprivs, if need be, and to allow finer-grained control
         over the capabilities manipulated by mod_linuxprivs.

       ServerLog:
         This directive allows for separate per-virtual server logs.

       TransferRate:
         The six Rate* directives are deprecated, and replaced with
         this single new directive.  TransferRate can be used on a per-
         directory basis, and set per-user, per-group, and per-Class. 

  - Enhanced configuration directives:
      Allow/Deny User/Group:
        A 'regex' keyword has been added to the AllowUser, DenyUser,
        AllowGroup, and DenyGroup directives, so that an administrator
        can specify user or group name filters based on regular
        expressions.

      ExtendedLog:
        The ExtendedLog directive can now take a "path" of the form:
        "syslog:level", where the "syslog:" prefix tells mod_log to log
        that ExtendedLog data via syslog, and the "level" informs mod_log
        of which syslog level to use.

  - New modules:
      mod_auth_file:
        The handling of AuthUserFile and AuthGroupFile has been condensed
        into this module; those directives have also been enhanced with
        the addition of "filters", which allow the administrator to exert
        some control over the contents of these replacement files.

      mod_rewrite:
        A command rewriting module based on regular expressions, similar
        to Apache's module of the same name.

      mod_tls:
        A module that implements FTP over SSL, according to an IETF Draft
        describing the technique.  This allows for encrypted control and
        data FTP connections.

    Also, the mod_pam module has been renamed to mod_auth_pam, and the
    mod_unixpw module has been renamed to mod_auth_unix, for naming
    consistency.  The configure options for these modules have been
    altered accordingly.

  - New Display file variables:
      %i, %o, %t:
        These variables expand to the total number of files uploaded
        (input), downloaded (output), and transferred, respectively.

  - New log format variables:
      %d, %D:
        %d will log just the directory name, not the full path, for the
        following FTP commands: CDUP, CWD, MKD, RMD, XCWD, XCUP, XMKD,
        and XRMD.  %D will log the full path for those same commands.

      %U:
        This variable expands the USER command originally sent by the
        client; in some cases (e.g. when UserAlias is used), this name
        will be different from that reported by %u (which expands to
        the name of the authenticated user).

  - RFC2389 support
