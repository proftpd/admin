Hello, ProFTPD community. The ProFTPD Project team is pleased to announce
that the second release candidate for ProFTPD 1.2.7 is now available
for public consumption.

You can download 1.2.7rc2, including PGP signatures and MD5 sums, from any
of the proftpd mirrors.  Mirrors are available via FTP as

  ftp.<two_letter_iso_country_code>.proftpd.org

(example: ftp.nl.proftpd.org).  Not all countries have mirrors; however
you should select one that is geographically close to you.

Alternatively, you can download proftpd from the main site:

  ftp://ftp.proftpd.org/distrib/source

RPMs, once available, will be placed here:

  ftp://ftp.proftpd.org/distrib/packages/RPMS

The 1.2.7rc2 release is mostly a bugfix release, with some additions:

  - New configure options for setting "tunable" options at configure-time

  - New LogFormat tags:
      %L for local server IP address
      %V for local server FQDN

Please read the included NEWS and ChangeLog files for the full details.
