Hello, ProFTPD community. The ProFTPD Project team is pleased to announce
that the first release candidate for ProFTPD 1.2.6 is now available
for public consumption.

You can download 1.2.6rc1, including PGP signatures and MD5 sums, from any
of the proftpd mirrors.  Mirrors are available via FTP as

  ftp.<two_letter_iso_country_code>.proftpd.org

(example: ftp.nl.proftpd.org).  Not all countries have mirrors; however
you should select one that is geographically close to you.

Alternatively, you can download proftpd from the main site:

  ftp://ftp.proftpd.org/distrib/source

RPMs, once available, will be placed here:

  ftp://ftp.proftpd.org/distrib/packages/RPMS

The 1.2.6rc1 includes numerous new features, including:

  - Large File Support:
     If the host system supports files larger than 2 GB, proftpd detects
     and configures itself to support these large files.

  - New configuration directives:
     <IfDefine>, <IfModule>, Define (and the -D command-line option), all
     of which function similarly to their Apache equivalents

  - Support for the STOU (STOre Unique) FTP command

  - Cygwin support:
     See README.cygwin for details.
 
  - New mod_sql, version 4.09:
     This version adds support for additional groups

Please read the included NEWS and ChangeLog files for the full details.

My PGP key has been used to sign the source tarballs as well as this
announcement; it is available via MIT's public keyserver.
