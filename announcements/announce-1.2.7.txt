Hello, ProFTPD community. The ProFTPD Project team is pleased to announce
that the final release for ProFTPD 1.2.7 is now available for public
consumption.

You can download 1.2.7, including PGP signatures and MD5 sums, from any
of the proftpd mirrors.  Mirrors are available via FTP as

  ftp.<two_letter_iso_country_code>.proftpd.org

(example: ftp.nl.proftpd.org).  Not all countries have mirrors; however
you should select one that is geographically close to you.

Alternatively, you can download proftpd from the main site:

  ftp://ftp.proftpd.org/distrib/source

RPMs, once available, will be placed here:

  ftp://ftp.proftpd.org/distrib/packages/RPMS

The 1.2.7 release is mostly a bugfix release.  Please read the included
NEWS and ChangeLog files for the full details.
