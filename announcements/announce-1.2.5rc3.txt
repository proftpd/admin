Hello, ProFTPD community. The ProFTPD Project team is pleased to announce
that the third release candidate for ProFTPD 1.2.5 is now available
for public consumption.

You can download 1.2.5rc3, including PGP signatures and MD5 sums, from any
of the proftpd mirrors.  Mirrors are available via FTP as

  ftp.<two_letter_iso_country_code>.proftpd.org

(example: ftp.nl.proftpd.org).  Not all countries have mirrors; however
you should select one that is geographically close to you.

Alternatively, you can download proftpd from the main site:

  ftp://ftp.proftpd.org/distrib/source

RPMs, once available, will be placed here:

  ftp://ftp.proftpd.org/distrib/packages/RPMS

The 1.2.5rc3 release includes numerous bug fixes.  Of particular interest:

  - new mod_ratio, version 3.3:
    This version fixes numerous bugs and compatibility issues.  Read
    the contrib/README.ratio for more details.

  - new mod_ldap, version 2.8.6:
    This version fixes some minor memory leaks and segfaults.

  - a bug causing timeouts to not function properly (usually manifesting
    as idle connections not being properly kicked off) has been
    corrected.

Please read the included NEWS and ChangeLog files for the full details.

My PGP key has been used to sign the source tarballs as well as this
announcement; it is available via MIT's public keyserver.
