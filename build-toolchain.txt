Current build toolchain:

  aclocal-1.10
  autoconf-2.61
  libtool-2.2.4
  make-3.81

To generate the aclocal.m4 file, use:

  # cd proftpd/
  # aclocal -I m4 -I lib/libltdl/m4

To generate the configure script, use:

  # cd proftpd/
  # autoconf

If you change the configure.in file, check in the change -- then wait for
a minute or two:

  # cvs commit configure.in
  # <wait>
  # autoconf
  # cvs commit configure

This will ensure that the modification time of the configure script in the
CVS repository is later than the modification time of the configure.in file.
This is important!  make will try to re-create the configure file if its
modification timestamp is NOT newer than the configure.in modification time.

Note that automake, autoheader, etc are NOT used.

Tools to use for source code analysis:

  cppcheck
  rats
  valgrind
