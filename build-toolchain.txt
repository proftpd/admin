Current build toolchain:

  aclocal-1.10
  autoconf-2.69
  libtool-2.2.4
  make-3.81

To generate the aclocal.m4 file, use:

  # cd proftpd/
  # aclocal -I m4 -I lib/libltdl/m4

To generate the configure script, use:

  # cd proftpd/
  # autoconf -W cross

The "-W cross" option will warn of things that will cause problems for
cross-compilers; we would like people to be able to cross-compile proftpd
e.g. for mobile platforms.

Note that automake, autoheader, etc are NOT used.

Tools to use for source code analysis:

  cppcheck
  rats
  valgrind

And now various GitHub/OSS linters and checkers:

  Codacy
  LGTM
